#### Convolution
It is like travelling the whole image by using kernel and do the dot product so that we can get the relation.
#### Filters/Kernels
  It is in the form of a matrix and it extracts the feature.It is also known as Feature Extractor.
#### Epochs
  Iterating the whole dataset which is divided into batches. To complete whole dataset one time such iteration is known as 1 Epoch.
#### 1x1 Convolution
  It just having 1x1xchannels which consists of the features of an image output in that single 1x1.
#### 3x3 Convolution
  It iterates on an image by 3x3 and it extracts the features and form that in 3x3 matrix in this convolution layer.
#### Feature Map
  It is simply collection of features from the channels.
#### Activation Function
  It is an non-linear function which hepls in mapping alot.
#### Receptive Field
  It should be the size of the object . In simple way we can say that how many pixels it can see in the original image.
